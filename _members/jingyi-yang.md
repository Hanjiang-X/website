Jingyi "Violet" Yang is a graduate of the Clinical Psychology master’s program at Columbia University’s Teachers College. She earned her B.A. in Psychological Science and Criminology, Law, and Society from the University of California, Irvine, where she worked with Dr. Jason Schiffman on research exploring social determinants of psychosis. During her master’s program, Violet worked with Dr. Cheryl Corcoran at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, contributing to studies on psychosis risk and digital phenotyping. Violet’s research interests center on suicide prevention, internalized stigma, and self-related cognitive-affective processes in psychosis. She is particularly interested in applying natural language processing, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and formal theoretical modeling to better understand acute suicidal states and self-disturbance. Outside of research, she is passionate about freediving and marine animal conservation.
