Meenakshi is currently pursuing her master's degree in clinical psychology at Teachers College, Columbia University. More broadly, she is passionate about Global Mental Health research and using technology to make mental health services more accessible. Specifically, she is interested in the emergence of depression, suicidal thoughts, and behaviors in transitional periods (i.e., adolescence, motherhood, etc.) and how these symptoms might differ across cultures, which ultimately informs interventions. Apart from academics, Meenakshi is a foodie exploring NYC eating joints!
