## Highlights

{% capture text %}

Dr. Bloch-Elkouby’s grant-funded research program entails two distinct, and yet intertwined domains: (1) suicide prevention, with a focus on developing empirically-supported interventions to address suicidal crises and using artificial intelligence to train clinicians in effective approaches to assess and treat imminent risk among diverse patients; and (2) psychotherapy process research, with a focus on clinicians’ ability to develop strong alliances and provide  effective therapy to patients who are culturally similar and different.
