# Welcome to The Bloch-Elkouby Lab

Dr. Sarah Bloch-Elkouby is an Assistant Professor in the adult PsyD program at Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology and an Assistant Clinical Professor at the Mount Sinai Behavioral Health Center. She holds an LLB from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, a BSW from Bar-Ilan University, an MA in clinical psychology and a PhD in Clinical Psychology from the Derner School of Psychology at Adelphi.

Dr. Bloch-Elkouby’s grant-funded research program strives to bridge the gap between research and clinical practice, on the one hand, and between suicide prevention and psychotherapy research, on the other. As such, her research program entails two distinct, and yet intertwined domains: 

(1) _Suicide prevention_, with a focus on the development of effective approaches to recognize and address imminent risk for suicidal behaviors; 

(2) _Psychotherapy process and outcome research_, with a focus on the interpersonal dynamics and cultural factors that impact therapists’ and patients’ work together.

In collaboration with other research teams, the Bloch-Elkouby Lab develops cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence tools such as Virtual Human Interactions (VHI) and investigates their use to advance suicide prevention and psychotherapy research.

## Highlights

Dr. Bloch-Elkouby’s grant-funded research program entails two distinct, and yet intertwined domains: (1) suicide prevention, with a focus on developing empirically-supported interventions to address suicidal crises and using artificial intelligence to train clinicians in effective approaches to assess and treat imminent risk among diverse patients; and (2) psychotherapy process research, with a focus on clinicians’ ability to develop strong alliances and provide  effective therapy to patients who are culturally similar and different.
