## Suicide Prevention Research

<!-- {% include list.html component="card" data="projects" filters="group: suicide" %} -->

{% capture text %}
In recent years, there has been a worrying increase in child and adolescent suicide rates, particularly among individuals with marginalized ethno-racial and gender identities. Funded by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Young Investigator grant, this project evaluates the effectiveness of a novel AI-powered clinician training tool, the Virtual Human Interactions (VHI), to enhance clinical training in the assessment of imminent suicidal risk among diverse adolescent populations.

This project strives to combine new evidence-based tools in suicide prevention and psychotherapy research to develop a new and integrative approach to suicide risk assessment and intervention. Based on the recently developed Narrative Crisis Model of Suicide (NCM; Galynker, 2017), and the principles of the empirically supported Alliance-Focused Training (AFT; Eubanks et al., 2015; Muran & Eubanks, 2020), this approach promotes a collaborative and de-stigmatizing insight- and self-compassion- oriented framework, where patients and clinicians co-create an individualized model of patients’ Narrative-Crisis stages while addressing and resolving ruptures in the alliance in real-time.

## Psychotherapy Research

<!-- {% include list.html component="card" data="projects" filters="group: culture" %} -->

{% capture text %}
To understand why some patients experience worsening symptoms or no improvement after undergoing therapy, our research delves into the interpersonal dynamics and the quality of the therapeutic alliance in therapy dyads using mixed-methods analyses. Aiming to uncover the underlying factors contributing to adverse therapy outcomes, this project is crucial for improving therapeutic techniques and strategies, ultimately enhancing their effectiveness and patient well-being.

Although recent research suggests that patients self-identifying as BIPOC underutilize treatment and terminate treatment prematurely, there is a paucity of research investigating the interpersonal dynamics at play within cross-cultural therapy dyads.  This project strives to deepen the field’s understanding of the interpersonal dynamics in cross-cultural dyads, identify obstacles to developing a strong therapeutic alliance, explore ethno-racial microaggressions, and assess their impact on therapy processes and outcomes.

This project aims to establish an observer-based coding scheme to identify ethnoracial racial microaggressions performed by patients or therapists in therapy, providing valuable insights for training and enhancing therapeutic practices.
