## Suicide Prevention Research Projects

Enhancing Suicide Risk Assessment Among Diverse Adolescents Using Virtual Human Interaction: In recent years, there has been a worrying increase in child and adolescent suicide rates, particularly among ethnic, racial, and sexual minorities. This project evaluates the effectiveness of a novel AI-powered clinician training tool, the Virtual Human Interaction (VHI), to enhance clinical training in the assessment of imminent suicidal risk among diverse adolescent populations.

Development of a new approach to suicide risk assessment and intervention: This project strives to combine new evidence-based tools in suicide prevention and psychotherapy research to develop a new and integrative approach to suicide risk assessment and intervention. Based on the recently developed Narrative Crisis Model of Suicide (NCM; Galynker, 2017), and the principles of the empirically supported Alliance-Focused Training (AFT; Eubanks et al., 2015; Muran & Eubanks, 2020), this approach promotes a collaborative and de-stigmatizing insight- and self-compassion- oriented framework, where patients and clinicians co-create an individualized model of patients’ Narrative-Crisis stages while addressing and resolving ruptures in the alliance in real-time.

## Multi-cultural Psychotherapy and Alliance Research

<!-- {% include list.html component="card" data="projects" filters="group: culture" %} -->

{% capture text %}
Understanding Treatment Deterioration and Patient-Therapist Interpersonal Dynamics: To understand why some patients experience worsening symptoms or no improvement after undergoing therapy, our research delves into the interpersonal dynamics and the quality of the therapeutic alliance in therapy dyads using mixed-methods analyses. Aiming to uncover the underlying factors contributing to adverse therapy outcomes, this project is crucial for improving therapeutic techniques and strategies, ultimately enhancing their effectiveness and patient well-being.

Exploring Alliance Ruptures, Resolutions, and Microaggressions Among Cross-Cultural and White Dyads: Although recent research suggests that patients self-identifying as BIPOC underutilize treatment and terminate treatment prematurely, there is a paucity of research investigating the interpersonal dynamics at play within cross-cultural therapy dyads.  This project strives to deepen the field’s understanding of the interpersonal dynamics in cross-cultural dyads, identify obstacles to developing a strong therapeutic alliance, explore ethno-racial microaggressions, and assess their impact on therapy processes and outcomes.

Development of an observer-based measure of ethnoracial microaggressions: This project aims to establish an observer-based coding scheme to identify ethnoracial racial microaggressions performed by patients or therapists in therapy, providing valuable insights for training and enhancing therapeutic practices.
