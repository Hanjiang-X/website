## Suicide Prevention Research

{% capture text %}

In recent years, there has been a worrying increase in child and adolescent suicide rates, particularly among ethnic, racial, and sexual minorities. This project evaluates the effectiveness of a novel AI-powered clinician training tool, the Virtual Human Interaction (VHI), to enhance clinical training in the assessment of imminent suicidal risk among diverse adolescent populations.

This project strives to combine new evidence-based tools in suicide prevention and psychotherapy research to develop a new and integrative approach to suicide risk assessment and intervention. Based on a recently developed evidence-based model of suicide, the Narrative Crisis Model of Suicide (NCM; Galynker, 2017), and the principles of the empirically supported Alliance-Focused Training (AFT; Eubanks et al., 2015; Muran & Eubanks, 2020), this approach promotes a collaborative and de-stigmatizing insight- and self-compassion- oriented framework, where patients and clinicians co-create an individualized model of patientsâ€™ Narrative-Crisis stages while addressing and resolving ruptures in the alliance in real-time.
